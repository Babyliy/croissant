          A croissant is a French pastry made from puff pastry in a crescent
          shape. <br>It is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the
          shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened
          laminated dough. <br> Croissants are named for their historical crescent
          shape. <br> The croissant gets its name from its shape: in French, the word
          means "crescent" or "crescent of the moon."
