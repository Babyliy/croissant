        <P>A croissant is a French pastry made from puff pastry in a crescent shape. It is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough. Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape. The croissant gets its name from its shape: in French, the word means "crescent" or "crescent of the moon." </P>
